# Web3: The Present and Future of the Decentralized Internet

## Abstract

Web3 marks a structural shift in digital architecture, replacing centralized models with distributed systems based on blockchain. This article analyzes the current state of Web3, its fundamental technologies, real-world use cases, technical and economic limitations, as well as future perspectives in infrastructure, governance, identity, and new models of digital ownership.

**Keywords:** Web3, Blockchain, Decentralization, Layer 2, DAOs, Decentralized Identity, Cryptoeconomy.

## 1. Introduction

The evolution of the internet can be summarized in three phases:

- **Web1:** reading and static content.

- **Web2:** centralized platforms and data capture.

- **Web3:** digital ownership, interoperability, and user control.

Web3 proposes a structural reorganization: the user ceases to be a product and becomes the owner of their data, identity, and digital assets.

## 2. Technological Foundations of Web3

### 2.1 Decentralization
Removes single points of control and reduces dependence on intermediaries.

### 2.2 Blockchain
Ensures data integrity and auditability.

New architectures:
- **Layer 2 (L2):** Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync

- **Modularity:** Celestia (execution separate from consensus)

### 2.3 Cryptoeconomy
Incentive systems that keep networks active.

Examples:

- staking (Lido)
- restaking (EigenLayer)

### 2.4 NFTs and Digital Property
Applications have evolved to:

- verifiable credentials
- tokenized tickets
- access and authentication

### 2.5 Smart Contracts
Automated execution without intermediaries.

Current Trend:

- **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337)**

## 3. Real-World Applications in 2024–2025

### 3.1 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Adoption measured by TVL (Total Value Locked):

Insights:
- Peak in 2021
- Retraction in 2022
- Gradual recovery post-2023
- Maturity surpasses speculation

Key Protocols:
- Uniswap v4
- Lido
- Aave

---

### 3.2 NFTs — From Speculation to Utility

![NFT Volume](nft_volume.png)

Trends:
- Decline after speculative boom
- Real-world use in:

- Membership
- Ticketing
- Identity Verifiable
- Focus on interoperability, not expensive art

---

### 3.3 Infrastructure and Interoperability

Main advances:

- Chainlink CCIP
- Cosmos IBC
- Polygon 2.0

---

### 3.4 Decentralized Identity (DID)

Applications:
- Passwordless login
- Selective privacy with ZKPs
- ENS + verifiable credentials

---

### 3.5 Layer-2 Adoption

Data conclusion:
- Reduced cost accelerates adoption
- Scalability ceases to be a barrier
- The future of Web 3 occurs in L2, not in new L1s

---

## 4. Structural Challenges of Web 3

### 4.1 Scalability
Dependent on:

- Danksharding
- More rollups Efficient

### 4.2 Usability
Main problems:
- seed phrases
- complex interfaces
- irreversible loss of funds

Solution:
- abstract blockchain from the end user

### 4.3 Security
Risks:
- exploits
- rug pulls
- dependence on oracles

### 4.4 Hidden Centralization
Occurs in:
- RPCs (Infura, Alchemy)
- dominant validators
- VCs with a large share of the supply

### 4.5 Regulation
Balance between:
- consumer protection
- innovation
- global harmonization

---

## 5. The Future of Web 3

### 5.1 Invisible Blockchain
End user unaware of underlying technology.

### 5.2 Portable Identity
Interoperable and private credentials.

### 5.3 Real Asset Tokenization (RWA)
Connection with traditional markets.

### 5.4 Programmable Governance
Hybrid DAOs with:

- dynamic quorum
- automatic accountability

### 5.5 New Digital Property
From an access economy to **verifiable ownership**.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Web3 doesn't depend on new blockchains, but on:

- abstracting complexity
- ensuring real security
- delivering utility beyond speculation

The turning point happens when Web3 ceases to be perceived—and becomes infrastructure.
