# Web3: The Present and Future of the Decentralized Internet

## Abstract

Web3 marks a structural shift in digital architecture, replacing centralized models with distributed systems based on blockchain. This article analyzes the current state of Web3, its fundamental technologies, real-world use cases, technical and economic limitations, as well as future perspectives in infrastructure, governance, identity, and new models of digital ownership. The approach includes objective critiques and verifiable trends beyond speculative discourse.

**Keywords:** Web3, Blockchain, Decentralization, Layer 2, DAOs, Decentralized Identity, Cryptoeconomy.

## 1. Introduction

The evolution of the internet can be summarized in three phases:

- **Web1:** static content and one-way reading.

- **Web2:** centralized platforms, social networks, data capture.

- **Web3:** digital ownership, decentralized protocols, and programmable interoperability.

Web 3 emerges as a response to the concentration of power, lack of privacy, and dependence on intermediaries. Unlike Web 2, where the user is the product, Web 3 places assets, identity, and data under the individual's control—without depending on a single entity.

More than a trend, Web 3 represents a **structural reorganization** of the internet.

## 2. Technological Foundations of Web 3

### **2.1 Decentralization**
Eliminates single points of control, increasing resistance to censorship and systemic failures.

### **2.2 Blockchain**
Distributed ledger that guarantees data integrity and auditability.

**Relevant new architectures:**

- **Layer 2 (L2):** Optimism, Arbitrum, zkSync → cost reduction and increased throughput.

- **Modular Blockchains:** Celestia → separation of execution, consensus, and data availability.

### **2.3 Cryptoeconomy**
Incentive mechanisms that keep networks active without central authorities.

Examples:
- staking (Lido, Ethereum PoS)
- restaking and shared security (EigenLayer)

### **2.4 NFTs and Digital Property**
Evolved from speculative art to:
- interoperable items
- ticket tokenization
- access and authentication
- verifiable credentials

### **2.5 Smart Contracts**
Self-executing code that eliminates intermediaries in financial and logical agreements.

Current trend:

- **Account Abstraction (ERC-4337):** wallets with Web2-like UX (social retrieval, seed phrase-free login).

## 3. Real-World Applications in 2024–2025

### **3.1 Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
Programmable financial services without banks. - **Uniswap v4:** liquidity with custom logic (hooks).

- **Lido:** Ethereum liquid staking.

- **Aave:** automated collateralized credit.

---

### **3.2 Infrastructure and Interoperability**
Web3 advances towards a connected ecosystem.

- **Chainlink CCIP:** communication between blockchains and traditional systems.

- **Cosmos IBC:** native interoperability between independent networks.

- **Polygon 2.0:** unified liquidity layer.

---

### **3.3 Decentralized Identity (DID)**
Identity control without central providers.

- **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)**

- **Verifiable Credentials (W3C)**

- **Passkeys + Wallets AA**

Emerging uses:
- passwordless login
- proof of humanity
- selective privacy (zero-knowledge proofs)

---

### **3.4 Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**
Governance via smart contracts.

Functional cases:
- programmed treasuries
- transparent voting
- global capital allocation

Current challenge:
- concentration of votes by large token holders.

---

### **3.5 Real-World Asset Tokenization (RWA)**
Integrates assets from the physical world to the digital world.

Examples:
- tokenized government bonds
- fractional ownership of real estate
- carbon credits

Trend:

- integration with regulated institutions.

## 4. Structural Challenges of Web3

### **4.1 Scalability**
Adoption depends on:

- more efficient rollups
- data availability (danksharding)

### **4.2 Usability**
Main barriers:

- seed phrases
- unintuitive interfaces
- irreversible loss of funds

Solution in progress:

- abstraction of the blockchain for the end user.

### **4.3 Security**
Predominant risks:
- Contract exploits
- Rug pulls
- Oracle dependency

### **4.4 Hidden Centralization**
Even in decentralized systems, there is concentration in:
- RPC providers (Infura, Alchemy)
- Dominant validators
- VCs with large token allocation

### **4.5 Regulation**
Current dilemma:
- Need for legal clarity
- Risk of stifling innovation
- Different approaches between countries

## 5. The Future of Web 3

### **5.1 Invisible Blockchain**
The end user will not need to know they are using blockchain.

### **5.2 Portable Identity**
Verifiable credentials, with selective privacy and global interoperability.

### **5.3 Integration with the Traditional System**
RWA and programmable payments should connect banks and public networks.

5.4 Governance Programmable**
DAOs will evolve into:
- hybrid models
- dynamic quorum
- automated accountability

### **5.5 New Ownership Models**
From the access economy to the **verifiable digital ownership** economy.

## 6. Conclusion

Web3 is not just a technological evolution—it's a restructuring of the power model on the internet. Its success depends less on new blockchains and more on abstracting complexity, ensuring real security, and delivering utility beyond speculation. As scalability, decentralized identity, and interoperability mature, Web3 ceases to be a promise and becomes infrastructure.

The decisive point will not be when everyone uses blockchain, but when nobody realizes they are using it.
