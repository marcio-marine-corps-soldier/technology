Project developed as part of the **“Creating Your First Ethereum Cryptocurrency”** challenge from **Digital Innovation One (DIO)**.

The goal is to create, compile, and deploy an **ERC-20 token**, applying fundamental concepts of blockchain, smart contracts, and code versioning.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand how a token works on the Ethereum network

- Create a smart contract following the **ERC-20** standard

- Compile and deploy the contract

- Interact with the token through a digital wallet

- Document the entire process clearly and professionally

---

## 🧠 Applied Concepts

- Ethereum Blockchain

- Smart Contracts
- ERC-20 Standard

- Solidity
- Smart Contract Deployment
- Interaction with wallets (MetaMask)

- Version control with Git and GitHub

- Project organization and documentation

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Access the **Remix IDE**.

2. Compile the smart contract written in Solidity.

3. Connect Remix to **MetaMask** using the *Injected Provider*.

4. Deploy the contract to a test network (e.g., Sepolia).

5. Add the token to MetaMask using the contract address.

6. Test functionalities such as:

- `totalSupply`

- `transfer`

- `approve`

- `transferFrom`
