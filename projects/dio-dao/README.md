# 🎵 SOUNDCHAIN ​​DAO

### The first decentralized Web3 record label

## 📌 Overview

The **SoundChain DAO** is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization created to finance, produce, and monetize music from independent artists using **Blockchain, NFTs, and Smart Contracts**.

We eliminate intermediaries, distribute royalties automatically, and allow fans to become investors in the artists. ---

## 🎯 Mission

To democratize the music industry, giving financial and creative power directly to artists and the community.

---

## 🚨 Problem

The traditional model is broken:

* Record labels keep the lion's share of the profits
* Artists receive little
* Royalties take months to be paid
* Fans don't participate in the growth

---

## 💡 Solution

The DAO works like a **Web3 record label**:

* Community funds music projects
* Artists receive initial investment
* Songs become tokenized NFTs/streams
* Royalties are paid automatically on-chain
* Holders earn a share of the revenue

---

## 🏗️ Structure

### 👥 Roles

* 🎤 Artists → create music
* 🎧 Producers → mix/master
* 💻 Developers → Web3 infrastructure
* 🗳️ Token holders → vote on projects
* 💰 DAO Treasury → funds Productions

---

## 🗳️ Governance

Model: **Token Voting (Snapshot + Smart Contracts)**

Flow:

1. Artist submits proposal (EP/album/single)
2. Community reviews
3. Voting with tokens
4. Treasury automatically releases funds
